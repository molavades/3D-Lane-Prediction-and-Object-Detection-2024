## Research Goals
**Lane Topology Prediction:**

Predict adjacency between lane segments in road networks.
Train and compare models like MLPs, CNNs, and Graph Neural Networks (optional).

**Object Detection on Merged Views:**

Merge camera views into front and rear perspectives.
Train object detection models (e.g., YOLO) to identify objects in these views.

**3D Centerline Prediction:**

Use advanced CNN and Vision Transformer models to predict 3D centerline points from images.
Evaluate predictions with metrics like Frechet Distance and Chamfer Distance.

**3D Positional Encoding:**

Assign unique 3D coordinates to detected objects around a vehicle to create spatial awareness.

## Objectives  
### **Research Assignments**
#### **Assignment 1: Lane-Lane Topology Prediction**
- **Goal:** Predict adjacency between lane segments in a road network.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Input: 3D centerline points for each lane segment.  
  - Ground Truth: Lane-lane adjacency matrix.  
  - Models:  
    - MLP (Feed-Forward Network) or CNN.  
    - Optional: Graph Neural Networks for enhanced performance.  
  - Evaluation: Binary classification for lane adjacency.

#### **Assignment 2: Object Detection on Merged Views**
- **Goal:** Detect objects in merged front and rear views of images.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Merge frames into **front views** and **rear views** using multiple camera angles.  
  - Train or fine-tune a **CNN (e.g., YOLO)** for object detection.  
  - Bonus:  
    - Remove artifacts using camera parameters and feature maps.  
    - Create a **360Â° Annular Panoramic View**.  

#### **Assignment 3: 3D Centerline Prediction**
- **Goal:** Predict 3D centerline points from input images and annotations.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Models: Pre-trained **VGG-16** and **ResNet-50**, modified for regression.  
  - Metrics:  
    - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for loss.  
    - **Frechet Distance** and **Chamfer Distance** for evaluation.  
  - Dataset: Subset of **OpenLaneV2**.

### **Final Research Project**
#### **Milestone 1: Positional Encoding for Object Detection**  
- **Goal:** Implement a 3D space around the ego center of the vehicle to uniquely encode all detected objects.  
- **Example:** Assign unique coordinates to bounding boxes relative to the vehicle's position at the origin `(0,0,0)`.

#### **Milestone 2: Vision Transformer for 3D Centerline Prediction**
